# Fintness-App
A cross platform mobile Fitness app.

Recently Hitesh sir (Official Youtube channel: Hitesh Choudhary) challenged us to create an mobile application for a fitness freak.
The challenge was divided into 3 stages with level of difficulty 
increasing at each stage.

I saw this video almost 5 days ago and decided to accept the 
challenge as I am also a begginer in mobile app development (mainly Flutter). I managed to create this app in 5 days and I 
know this app lacks many functionalites but since it was a client
work so I added only those functionlities which were asked by the 
client.

Also, if you want to challenge yourself too then link of the 
video is given below. give it a try
